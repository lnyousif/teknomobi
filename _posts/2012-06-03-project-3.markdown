description: This project was particuarly challenging as it required a lot of collaboration. It included the need to create a central widdget server that collects data from multiple data sources to be presented as a web service that implements strong caching due to high traffic. The front end was a sophisticated system that included more than several libraries from Google maps injection to API consumption with the full support of all browser types.
