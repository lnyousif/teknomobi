                <p>
                    We use Scrum, Kanban or lean methodologies.

                    We take care about the quality of your project so that it will be easily maintainable.
                    We use BDD (form of TDD) focused on integration testing – outside-in approach.
                    We use GIT repository and own CI server. Every change is reviewed by second experienced developer.
